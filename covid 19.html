      <h3>WHAT IS A PANDEMIC?</h3>
      <p>According to the WHO, a pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a pandemic as “an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.” The same body defines an epidemic as “an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.” Thus, the ‘pandemic’ status has to do more with the spread of the disease, than its severity. 
On February 24, Dr Michael J Ryan, a senior WHO official, told reporters that the word “pandemic comes from the Greek ‘pandemos’, which means everybody”, CNN reported. “Demos means the population. Pan meaning everyone. So ‘pandemos’ is a concept where there’s a belief that the whole world’s population will likely be exposed to this infection and potentially a proportion of them fall sick,” Dr Ryan said.

      <h3>WHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?</h3>
      <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less severe common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The SARS-CoV-21 is a coronavirus very similar to the one that caused SARS. Many coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans. While the SARS coronavirus is thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats) and first infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002, the MERS coronavirus was passed on from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. There is evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 has also been transmitted from bats </p>

      <h3>STAGES OF PANDEMIC.</h3> 
      <p>Stage 1: A country is said to be in stage 1 of a pandemic when it is not the source of pandemic and still reports the first few cases of the disease due to the virus import. In case of the current coronavirus outbreak, all the countries other than China, when reported the very first case of the COVID-19, entered the stage 1 of the pandemic.
  Stage 2: A country reaches stage 2 of a pandemic when the local transmission of the disease starts occuring. This means that unlike stage 1, the people transmitting or spreading the infection belong to the country itself. 
 Stage 3: A country reaches stage 3 of an outbreak, when community transmission becomes a reality for it. In this phase, tracking chains of transmission of the disease becomes extremely difficult. Also, people even without any travel history to the affected area or any instance of being in contact with the affected person, start getting the infection 
Stage 4: When an infection, which has been announced a pandemic, becomes endemic in a country, that nation is said to be in stage 4. It is the worst stage of an outbreak when massive number of people start getting infected and the measures to contain the virus or control the number of affected patients seem almost impossible.</p>

      <h3>HOW DID IT START?</h3>
      <p>The swine flu was first recognised during the 1919 pandemic, but the H1N1 strain in the 2009 outbreak was first detected in humans in America. 
Research found the virus was a "reassortment" of influenza viruses, where bird, swine and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus. 
It is like a strain found in pigs in North America around 19992000. 
Spread and symptoms 
Like regular strains of influenza, swine flu is passed from person to person through exposure to infected droplets from coughing or sneezing, which can contaminate hands and surfaces. 
Symptoms also mimic the flu, with patients experiencing fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and runny nose, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Most people who were infected with swine flu during the pandemic suffered from mild cases of the illness and recovered without treatment. 
There were a number of difficulties in counting the death toll of the swine flu, including differentiating it from other strains 
of influenza, and a lack of lab testing facilities in some regions.</P>

      <h3>WHY TO WERE MASKS? </h3>
      <p>Medical masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus infection. If worn properly, masks may be effective in preventing transmission of coronavirus. An article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) says there is no evidence to suggest that masks worn by healthy individuals can help prevent infection. But a 2010 study says: “Mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations.” Even the World Health Organization says wearing a medical mask is “one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in affected areas”. Transmission through droplets from coughing and sneezing is one of the major routes of virus spread. When worn correctly, a mask can reduce the risk of inhaling droplets containing the virus. With many studies showing that people infected with novel coronavirus transmit the virus even before symptoms show up, it may be prudent to wear a mask especially when the virus is spreading in the community. In a country like India, maintaining at least one metre distance can be a challenge, especially when there is no way of knowing who is infected till such time the person starts showing visible symptoms.</p>

      <h3>HOW IT SPREADS?</h3>
      <p>COVID-19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales small droplets produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing.The WHO recommends 1 metre (3 ft) of social distance the U.S. CDC recommends 2 metres (6 ft). People can transmit the virus without showing symptoms, but it is unclear how often this happens.One estimate of the number of those infected who are asymptomatic is 40%.

People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission). They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.

When the contaminated droplets fall to floors or surfaces they can, though less commonly, remain infectious if people touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. On surfaces the amount of active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection,and surfaces are thought not to be the main way the virus spreads.It is unknown what amount of virus on surfaces is required to cause infection via this method, but it can be detected for up to four hours on copper, up to one day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304). Surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which kill the virus outside the human body or on the hands.Disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for COVID-19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as when used inside the human body

Sputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus. Although COVID-19 is not a sexually transmitted infection, kissing, intimate contact, and faecal-oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus. Some medical procedures are aerosol-generating,and result in the virus being transmitted more easily than normal.

COVID-19 is a new disease, and many of the details of its spread are still under investigation. It spreads easily between people—easier than influenza but not as easily as measles. Estimates of the number of people infected by one person with COVID-19 (the R0) have varied widely. The WHO's initial estimates of the R0 were 1.4-2.5 (average 1.95), however a more recent[when?] review found the basic R0 (without control measures) to be higher at 3.28 and the median R0 to be 2.79.</p>

      <h3>HOW IT SPREADS?</h3>
      <p>
 Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected hundreds since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December. Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans.

"What we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesn't respond to antibiotic treatment, which is not surprising, but then in terms of mortality, SARS kills 10% of the individuals," Poon, a virologist at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong, said.
It's not clear how deadly the Wuhan coronavirus will be, but fatality rates are currently lower than both MERS and SARS. Experts stress that it will change as the outbreak develops.

The World Health Organization offered guidance to countries on how they can prepare for it, including how to monitor for the sick and how to treat patients. Here's what you should know about coronaviruses.
What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Coronavirus symptoms
The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days.
For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis.
There are a handful of human coronaviruses that are known to be deadly.
Middle East respiratory syndrome, also known as the MERS virus, was first reported in the Middle East in 2012 and also causes respiratory problems, but those symptoms are much more severe. Three to four out of every 10 patients infected with MERS died, according to the CDC.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS, is the other coronavirus that can cause more severe symptoms. First identified in the Guangdong province in southern China, according to the WHO, it causes respiratory problems but can also cause diarrhea, fatigue, shortness of breath, respiratory distress and kidney failure. Depending on the patient's age, the death rate with SARS ranged from 0-50% of the cases, with older people being the most vulnerable.
The Wuhan coronavirus is currently thought to be more mild than SARS and MERS and takes longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit the hospital, explains Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford. So far, around 15% to 20% of cases have become severe, requiring, for example, ventilation in the hospital.

The virus may occur in breast milk, but it's unknown whether it's infectious and transmittable to the baby</p>

      <h3>STRUCTURE OF CORONAVIRUSES</h3>
      <p>
Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles are spherical and have mushroom-shaped proteins called spikes protruding from their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike binds and fuses to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry.  Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the National Institutes of Health, U.S., have produced a 3D atomic scale map of the protein of the SARS-CoV-2 that binds to and infects human cells.  Mapping the 3D structure of the protein — spike (S) glycoprotein — will allow better understanding of how the virus binds to the human cells. Knowing the structure of the spike protein will, in turn, allow scientists to develop vaccines and antivirals against the virus and even better diagnostics.  
 
 
The spike protein of the novel coronovirus shares 98% sequence identity with the spike protein of the bat coronavirus, the researchers say. The results were published in the journal Science.   Similar yet different  The researchers also found that like in the case of the SARS coronavirus, the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 that causes Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19)2 binds to the cellular receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as the entry point into human cells. But unlike in the case of SARS, the spike protein of the novel coronavirus binds to the cell receptor with much higher affinity — 10- to 20-fold higher. </p>

      <h3>IMPORTANCE OF SOAP</h3>
      <p>
 Washing with soap The grime on our hands contains innumerable viruses and bacteria. Washing with water without using soap helps reduce the amount of microbes but does not remove most of the virus and bacteria completely. Using soap, therefore, becomes far more effective in removing microbes. Viruses such as coronavirus, influenzacausing viruses, Ebola, Zika have their genetic material encased in a layer of fat called the lipid envelope8 . Soap molecules are pin-shaped with a head that is waterloving (hydrophilic) and a tail that is oil-loving (oleophilic). Being oleophilic, the tail portion of the molecule tends to have an affinity for and ‘competes’ with the lipids in the virus envelope. Since the chemical bonds holding the virus together are not very strong, the long oleophilic tail gets 
inserted into the envelope and tends to have a ‘crowbar’ effect that breaks the lipid envelope of the virus. The tail also competes with the bond that binds the RNA and the lipid envelop thus dissolving the virus into its components which are then removed by water.</p>

      <h3>MYTHS ON CORONAVIRUSES</h3>
      <p>
Myth: “COVID-19 virus cannot be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates” 
 
From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. 
Myth: The new coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites. To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>ALCOHOL-BASED HAND SANITISERS</h3>
      <p>Like soap, the alcohol present in hand sanitisers dissolve the lipid envelope, thus inactivating the virus. In addition, the alcohol also tends to change the shape or denature the mushroom-shaped protein structures that stick out of the lipid envelope. The mushroom-shaped protein structures help the virus to bind to special structures found on human cells and enter the cells. To be effective, the sanitisers should contain at least 60% alcohol. Unlike soap lather, the alcohol does not come in contact with all parts of the hand. So care needs to be taken to use sufficient sanitiser to increase the coverage. Unlike water, alcohol run does not remove the dead viruses from the hand. While a sanitiser can quickly reduce the number of microbes, it does not get rid of all types of germs, and is “not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy</p>
